Sometimes the names are confused by Tesla owners and the public.\n\nTesla says at present neither system can drive itself and that human drivers must be ready to take control at any time.\n\n\u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d is being tested on public roads by selected Tesla owners. \n\nTwice NHTSA has made Tesla recall \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d because it disobeyed traffic laws. It also forced a recall of Autopilot, alleging that Tesla\u2019s system for making sure drivers pay attention was inadequate. In April, the agency began investigating whether the Autopilot recall actually worked. \n\n"

The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.\n\nFollowing the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin.\n\nDefense attorneys say the vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out in her January ruling, are adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package.\n\n\u201cHonoring the shoulder vote would affirm the strength of our corporate system,\u201d David Ross, an attorney for Musk and the other individual defendants, told McCormick. \u201cThis was stockholder democracy working.\u201d\n\nRoss told the judge that the defendants were not challenging the factual findings or legal conclusions in her ruling, but simply asking that she vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.\n\n\n\n\nMcCormick, however, seemed skeptical of the defense arguments, peppering attorneys with questions and noting that there is no precedent in Delaware law for allowing a post-trial shareholder vote to ratify adjudicated breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate directors.\n\n\u201cThis has never been done before,\u201d she said.\n\nDefense attorneys argued that, while they could find no case that is exactly comparable, Delaware law has long recognized shareholder ratification as a cure to corporate governance errors, and has long acknowledged the \u201csovereignty\u201d of shareholders as the ultimate owners of a corporation.\n\n\u201cI candidly don\u2019t see how Delaware law can tell the owners of the company that they\u2019re not entitled to make the decision they made,\u201d said Rudolf Koch, an attorney for Tesla.\n\nDonald Verrilli, a lawyer for an induvial stockholder who owns more than 19,000 Tesla shares, suggested that it would be wrong for the lone shareholder who filed the lawsuit to thwart the will of the majority of Tesla shareholders. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the plaintiff owned just nine shares of Tesla stock.\n\n\u201cThe voice of the majority of shareholders should matter\u2026. This lawsuit is not representing the interest of the shareholders,\u201d Verrilli said.\n\nThomas Grady, an attorney for a group of Florida objectors who own or manage almost 8 million Tesla shares with some $2 billion, argued that for McCormick to rule for the plaintiff, she has to \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d all other Tesla shareholders.\n\nGreg Varallo, an attorney for the plaintiff, urged McCormick not to give any credence to the June shareholder vote, saying it has no legal precedent in Delaware or anywhere else.

    "text": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Authorities in Washington have determined that a Tesla that hit and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle in April was operating on the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d system at the time of the crash. \n\nInvestigators from the Washington State Patrol made the discovery after downloading information from the event-data recorder on the 2022 Tesla Model S, agency spokesman Capt. Deion Glover said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe investigation is still ongoing in this case,\u201d Glover said in an email to The Associated Press. The Snohomish County Prosecutor will determine if any charges are filed in the case, he said. \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said last week that \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d should be able to run without human supervision by the end of this year. He has been promising a fleet of robotaxis for several years. During the company\u2019s earnings conference call, he acknowledged that his predictions on the issue \u201chave been overly optimistic in the past.\u201d \n\nA message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.\n\nAfter the crash in a suburban area about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Seattle, the driver told a trooper that he was using Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system and looked at his cellphone while the Tesla was moving.\n\n\u201cThe next thing he knew there was a bang and the vehicle lurched forward as it accelerated and collided with the motorcycle in front of him,\u201d the trooper wrote in a probable-cause document. \n\n\n\n\nThe 56-year-old driver was arrested for investigation of vehicular homicide \u201cbased on the admitted inattention to driving, while on Autopilot mode, and the distraction of the cell phone while moving forward, putting trust in the machine to drive for him,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nThe motorcyclist, Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was under the car and pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported.\n\nNissen\u2019s death is at least the second in the U.S. involving Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system. In investigative documents, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said earlier it had found one fatality and 75 crashes while the system was being used. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the system was at fault in the fatality. \n\nTesla has two partially automated driving systems, \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d which can take on many driving tasks even on city streets, and Autopilot, which can keep a car in its lane and away from objects in front of it.

Unencumbered by the din and acrid smell of a combustion engine, the boat\u2019s passengers could chat with Jeide as he surfed behind them while they savored the afternoon breeze wafting along the river. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a playground back there, you feel like you could just ride all day,\u201d exclaimed Jeide, part of the sales team at Arc Boats, a 3-year-old startup embarking on a voyage to electrify the waters in the same way that Tesla led the charge to electrify the roads.\n\nAs Tesla did with its first car 16 years ago, Arc Boats is starting with luxurious vessels likely to appeal to a small and affluent audience that isn\u2019t reluctant to spend large sums of money to own the latest advances in technology.\n\nThey\u2019re people like Jonathan Coon, a self-proclaimed geek who got rich after starting 1-800 Contacts in his college dorm room back in the 1990s and can afford to splurge on the sleek, high-powered vessels that Arc Boats is designing and building.\n\nAfter spending more than $300,000 on a luxury cruiser called Arc One a couple of years ago, Coon is forking over another $258,000 to become the first customer in line to get Arc Sport \u2014 a model made for popular aquatic pastimes such as wakeboarding and water skiing.\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s something that Coon wouldn\u2019t have considered buying just a few years ago after renting gas-powered boats and riding on the gas-powered boats of friends and hearing about all the hassles that went into maintaining them, along with the cost to fuel up vessels that usually only get a few miles per gallon.\n\n\u201cMy view on boats had always been that the best kind of boat is someone else\u2019s boat because they can be such nightmares,\u201d Coon, 54, said during an interview from Austin, Texas, where he is overseeing the development of a lakeside community. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case now. These guys just nailed every little detail on an electric boat that\u2019s just fun to use.\u201d\n\nArc Boats CEO Mitch Lee is a long-time nerd, too. He grew up in San Jose, California \u2014 the cradle of Silicon Valley \u2014 where he began trading in currency exchanges when he was just 8 years old. After moving on to Northwestern University to study mechanical engineering, Lee created a personal finance app called Penny that he sold in 2018 to Credit Karma, which is now owned by Intuit.\n\nThat deal helped provide Lee with the money to start Arc Boats in Southern California with Ryan Cook, a friend he met at Northwestern. Electrifying boats has been in the back of Lee\u2019s mind since Tesla rolled out its first car \u2014 the Roadster \u2014 in 2008 and he wondered if the technology would eventually work on the boats he grew to love as the son of parents who loved to water ski. \n\nThe success of Tesla\u2019s expanding line-up of vehicles and the electric cars made by other automakers finally created a supply chain of batteries and other parts needed to electrify boats, too. Arc Boats, founded in 2021, now employs more than 100 employees, including former engineers who worked for Elon Musk at two of his breakthrough companies \u2014 Tesla and rocket ship maker SpaceX. \n\nAfter selling only a handful of the Arc One luxury cruisers, Lee foresees being able to ramp up production to sell hundreds of the Arc Sport model across the U.S. annually.\n\nBesides its home state of California, Arc Boats is targeting other water-loving hot spots such as Texas, Idaho, Minnesota, Michigan and other parts of the country with lots of lakes and people who want to have fun on them. The first Arc Sport is supposed to be delivered to Coon before the end of this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for a product like this, because it solves all these core pain points that gas boat owners have today,\u201d Lee, 35, said while piloting an Arc Sport on the San Joaquin River near Bethel Island, California. \u201cIt\u2019s quieter. It\u2019s far more reliable. It\u2019s way cheaper to operate. You\u2019re not inhaling fumes off of the back of the boat.

But the sales were better than the 436,000 that analysts had expected. \n\nThe better-than-expected deliveries pushed Tesla\u2019s stock up 10% Tuesday. The stock is down about 7% so far this year, but it has nearly erased larger losses from prior months. Tesla shares had been down more than 40% earlier in the year, but are up more than 60% since hitting a 52-week low in April. \n\nDemand for EVs worldwide is slowing, but they\u2019re still growing for most automakers. Tesla, with an aging model lineup and relatively high average selling prices, has struggled more than other manufacturers. Still it retained the title of the world\u2019s top-selling electric vehicle maker.\n\nAP correspondent Tom Krisher reports Tesla sale numbers may be on the bounce back.\n\nFor the first half of the year, Tesla sold 830,766 electric vehicles worldwide, handily beating China\u2019s BYD, which sold 726,153 EVs.\n\nTesla also sold over 33,000 more vehicles during the second quarter than it produced, which should reduce the company\u2019s inventory on hand at its stores.\n\nTesla\u2019s sales decline comes as competition is increasing from legacy and startup automakers, which are trying to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share. Most other automakers will report U.S. sales figures later Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\nTesla gave no explanation for the sales decline, which is a harbinger of what to expect when it posts second-quarter earnings on July 23.\n\nNearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 21,551 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.\n\nThe sales decline came despite Tesla knocking $2,000 off the prices of three of its five models in the United States in April. The company cut the prices of the Model Y, Tesla\u2019s most popular model and the top-selling electric vehicle in the U.S., and also of the Models X and S.\n\nThe April cuts reduced the starting price for a Model Y to $42,990 and to $72,990 for a Model S and $77,990 for a Model X. Last week, Tesla lopped $2,340 off the $38,990 base price of some newly revamped Model 3s that were in the inventory shipped to its stores. \n\nIn addition, Tesla in May offered 0.99% financing for up to six years on the Model Y. In June, it offered interest as low as 1.99% for three years on the rear-wheel-drive Model 3. Typical new-vehicle interest rates average just over 7%, according to Edmunds.com.\n\nAlso during the quarter, Tesla knocked roughly a third off the price of its \u201cFull Self Driving\u201d system \u2014 which can\u2019t drive itself and so drivers must remain alert and be ready to intervene \u2014 to $8,000 from $12,000, according to the company website.\n\nJessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.com, said Tesla is having trouble in a market where most early adopters already have EVs, and mainstream buyers are more skeptical that electric cars can meet their needs. \n\nTesla\u2019s \u201chaphazard\u201d price cuts don\u2019t work as well as they once did because consumers now expect them, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the automaker exhaust its bag of tricks by lowering prices and increasing incentives to spur demand without much success in the U.S. market,\u201d Caldwell said. \n\nAlso, Tesla\u2019s aging model lineup doesn\u2019t look much different than it did years ago she said. And with price cuts, used Tesla prices tumbled. Anyone wanting a Tesla can get a far better deal buying a used one, Caldwell said. \n\nCaldwell doesn\u2019t see any big catalyst this year that would boost Tesla sales unless gasoline prices spike, and she said Musk\u2019s shift to the right since taking over Twitter has hurt the brand\u2019s image. \n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Tuesday that second-quarter sales were a \u201chuge comeback performance\u201d for Tesla. \u201cIn a nutshell, the worst is in the rearview mirror for Tesla,\u201d he wrote. The company, he wrote, cut 10% to 15% of its workforce to reduce costs and preserve profitability. \u201cIt appears better days are now ahead as the growth story returns,\u201d Ives wrote. \n\nIn its letter to investors in January, Tesla predicted \u201cnotably lower\u201d sales growth this year. The letter said Tesla is between two big growth waves, one from global expansion of the Models 3 and Y, and a second coming from the Model 2, a new, smaller and less expensive vehicle with an unknown release date.\n\n"

    "text": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 If Tesla shareholders vote against restoring Elon Musk\u2019s $44.9 billion pay package Thursday, the CEO could deliver on threats to take artificial intelligence research to one of his other companies. Or he could even could walk away.\n\nIf they approve the all-stock compensation package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge in January, it would almost guarantee he would remain at the company he grew to be the world leader in electric vehicles, shifting to AI and robotics including autonomous vehicles, which Musk says is Tesla\u2019s future.\n\nBut even with reapproval at Thursday\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, which many analysts say is likely, there would be uncertainty. Musk has threatened on X, his social media platform, to develop AI elsewhere if he doesn\u2019t get a 25% stake in Tesla (He owns about 13% now). Musk\u2019s xAI recently received $6 billion in funding to develop artificial intelligence. \n\nWedbush Analyst Dan Ives said he expects the package to be overwhelmingly reapproved, ending a lot of uncertainty with Musk. \u201cThis issue has been an overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock, and this will be important to move this distraction in the rearview mirror,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to investors.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. have slumped more than 30% this year with the company warning of \u201cnotably lower\u201d sales growth in 2024.\n\nAlso on the shareholder ballot is the related issue of moving the electric vehicle maker\u2019s legal home out of Delaware to Texas. \n\n\n\n\nThe move is designed to escape from the Delaware court\u2019s oversight and possibly a ruling from Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick that invalidated Musk\u2019s pay package. In a January opinion on a shareholder lawsuit, the judge determined that Musk controlled the Tesla board and is not entitled to the landmark package once worth nearly $56 billion.\n\nMultiple institutional investors have come out against that sizeable payout, some citing falling vehicle sales, price cuts and the tumbling Tesla stock price. But Tesla\u2019s top five institutional shareholders, Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Geode Capital, and Capital Research either said they don\u2019t announce their votes or wouldn\u2019t comment. They control about 17% of the votes. \n\nErik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said individual shareholders are likely to vote for the package, and they own more than half of Tesla\u2019s shares.\n\nOne institutional investor who came out against the package is California\u2019s State Teachers Retirement System. The large pension fund said Tuesday that it would vote against Musk\u2019s pay \u201cbased on its sheer magnitude, and because the award would be extremely dilutive to shareholders. We also have concerns with the lack of focus on profitability for the company.\u201d\n\nIn May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. \n\nBut Tesla and Musk have unleashed a furious lobbying effort to get the package approved, in posts on X, television appearances and in proxy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cOnly 2 days left to protect & help grow the value of your investment in $TSLA by voting FOR ratification of the 2018 CEO Performance Award,\u201d Tesla posted on X early Tuesday.\n\nTesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, in a letter to shareholders, wrote that the package was approved by 73% of the vote six years ago. \u201cBecause the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value. That strikes us\u2009\u2014\u2009and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard\u2009\u2014\u2009as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTesla has said the 2018 award incentivized Musk to create over $735 billion in value for shareholders in the six years since it was approved.\n\nIf Tesla finalizes the vote on moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas before the vote on Musk\u2019s pay package, and it manages to file the paperwork in Austin and get approval of the move, then the effect of the Delaware court ruling could be in doubt. Reapproval of the pay package would then be done as a Texas corporation and could fall under the purview of Texas courts.\n\nAnticipating a quick move by Tesla, lawyers for the shareholder who filed the lawsuit seeking to block Musk\u2019s pay deal, Richard Tornetta, filed motions in Delaware last month seeking an order stopping Tesla from trying to move the case. Tesla responded in letters to the judge that there is no cause for such concerns because they won\u2019t seek a move. Besides, Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of this week\u2019s shareholder vote, they wrote.\n\nIn an order denying Tornetta\u2019s motions, Chancellor McCormick wrote that she interprets Tesla\u2019s letters to mean it has no intention of relocating the case to Texas. \u201cThe defendants\u2019 statements give me great comfort,\u201d she wrote.\n\nEric Talley, a Columbia University law professor, said the lawyers are unlikely to try to move the case because their livelihood is handling business cases in Delaware courts.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that the unpredictable Musk could change lawyers.\n\nMcCormick, Talley said, is telling the lawyers \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to believe you, but I\u2019m going to be really irritated if this is a big send up for these things that you said you\u2019re not going to do.\u201d\n\nTalley, who also is a Tesla shareholder and said at present he plans to vote against Musk\u2019s pay, expects Tesla to follow through with appealing McCormick\u2019s ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. \n\n"

The package is likely to remain tied up in the Delaware Chancery Court and Supreme Court for months as Tesla tries to overturn the Delaware judge\u2019s rejection.\n\nMusk has raised doubts about his future with Tesla this year, writing on X, the social media platform he owns, that he wanted a 25% stake in the company in order to stop him from taking artificial intelligence development elsewhere. The higher stake is needed to control the use of AI, he has said.\n\nTesla also has struggled with falling sales and profit margins as demand for electric vehicles slows worldwide.\n\nBut at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday in Austin, Texas, Musk reassured shareholders that he will stick around, telling them he can\u2019t sell any stock in the compensation package for five years. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually cash, and I can\u2019t cut and run, nor would I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story is featured in our One Notable Number series, which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.\n\nTake a look at more Notable Numbers here.\n\nYou can also read more ONEs:\n\nThe company said late Thursday that shareholders had voted for Musk\u2019s compensation plan, which initially was approved by the board and stockholders six years ago.\n\n\n\n\nTesla last valued the package at $44.9 billion in an April regulatory filing. It was once as much as $56 billion but has declined in value in tandem with Tesla\u2019s stock, which has dropped about 25% so far this year.\n\nChancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled in January in a shareholder\u2019s lawsuit that Musk essentially controlled the Tesla board when it ratified the package in 2018, and that it failed to fully inform shareholders who approved it the same year.\n\nTesla has said it would appeal, but asked shareholders to reapprove the package at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nA separate vote approved moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas to avoid the courts in Delaware, where Tesla is registered as a corporation.\n\n\u201cIts incredible,\u201d a jubilant Musk told the crowd gathered at Tesla\u2019s headquarters and large factory in Austin, Texas. \u201cI think we\u2019re not just opening a new chapter for Tesla, we\u2019re starting a new book.\u201d\n\nMusk and Tesla didn\u2019t win everything. Shareholders approved measures that trimmed board member terms from three years to one and cut the required vote on shareholder proposals to a simple majority.\n\nLegal experts say the issue of Musk\u2019s pay will still be decided in Delaware, largely because Musk\u2019s lawyers have assured McCormick they won\u2019t try to move the case to Texas.\n\nBut they differ on whether the new ratification of the pay package will make it easier for Tesla to get it approved.\n\nCharles Elson, a retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said he doesn\u2019t think the vote will influence McCormick, who issued a decision based on the law.\n\nMcCormick\u2019s ruling essentially made the 2018 compensation package a gift to Musk, Elson said, and that would need unanimous shareholder approval, an impossible threshold. The vote, he said, is interesting from a public perception standpoint, but \u201cin my view it does not affect the ruling.\u201d\n\nJohn Lawrence, a Dallas-based lawyer with Baker Botts who defends corporations against shareholder lawsuits, agreed the vote doesn\u2019t end the legal dispute and automatically give Musk the stock options. But he says it gives Tesla a strong argument to get the ruling overturned.\n\nHe expects Musk and Tesla to argue that shareholders were fully informed before the latest votes, so McCormick should reverse her decision. But the plaintiff in the lawsuit will argue that the vote has no impact and isn\u2019t legally binding, Lawrence said.\n\nThe vote, he said, was done under Delaware law and should be considered by the judge. \n\n\u201cThis shareholder vote is a strong signal that you now have an absolutely well-informed body of shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judge in Delaware still could decide that this doesn\u2019t change a thing about her prior ruling and doesn\u2019t require her to make any different ruling going forward. But I think it definitely gives Tesla and Musk strong ammunition to try to get her to revisit this.\u201d\n\n"

The higher stake is needed to control the use of AI, he has said.\n\nTesla also has struggled with falling sales and profit margins as demand for electric vehicles slows worldwide.\n\nBut at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday in Austin, Texas, Musk reassured shareholders that he will stick around, telling them he can\u2019t sell any stock in the compensation package for five years. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not actually cash, and I can\u2019t cut and run, nor would I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story is featured in our One Notable Number series, which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.\n\nTake a look at more Notable Numbers here.\n\nYou can also read more ONEs:\n\nThe company said late Thursday that shareholders had voted for Musk\u2019s compensation plan, which initially was approved by the board and stockholders six years ago.\n\n\n\n\nTesla last valued the package at $44.9 billion in an April regulatory filing. It was once as much as $56 billion but has declined in value in tandem with Tesla\u2019s stock, which has dropped about 25% so far this year.\n\nChancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled in January in a shareholder\u2019s lawsuit that Musk essentially controlled the Tesla board when it ratified the package in 2018, and that it failed to fully inform shareholders who approved it the same year.\n\nTesla has said it would appeal, but asked shareholders to reapprove the package at Thursday\u2019s annual meeting.\n\nA separate vote approved moving the company\u2019s legal home to Texas to avoid the courts in Delaware, where Tesla is registered as a corporation.\n\n\u201cIts incredible,\u201d a jubilant Musk told the crowd gathered at Tesla\u2019s headquarters and large factory in Austin, Texas. \u201cI think we\u2019re not just opening a new chapter for Tesla, we\u2019re starting a new book.\u201d\n\nMusk and Tesla didn\u2019t win everything. Shareholders approved measures that trimmed board member terms from three years to one and cut the required vote on shareholder proposals to a simple majority.\n\nLegal experts say the issue of Musk\u2019s pay will still be decided in Delaware, largely because Musk\u2019s lawyers have assured McCormick they won\u2019t try to move the case to Texas.\n\nBut they differ on whether the new ratification of the pay package will make it easier for Tesla to get it approved.\n\nCharles Elson, a retired professor and founder of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said he doesn\u2019t think the vote will influence McCormick, who issued a decision based on the law.\n\nMcCormick\u2019s ruling essentially made the 2018 compensation package a gift to Musk, Elson said, and that would need unanimous shareholder approval, an impossible threshold. The vote, he said, is interesting from a public perception standpoint, but \u201cin my view it does not affect the ruling.\u201d\n\nJohn Lawrence, a Dallas-based lawyer with Baker Botts who defends corporations against shareholder lawsuits, agreed the vote doesn\u2019t end the legal dispute and automatically give Musk the stock options. But he says it gives Tesla a strong argument to get the ruling overturned.\n\nHe expects Musk and Tesla to argue that shareholders were fully informed before the latest votes, so McCormick should reverse her decision. But the plaintiff in the lawsuit will argue that the vote has no impact and isn\u2019t legally binding, Lawrence said.\n\nThe vote, he said, was done under Delaware law and should be considered by the judge. \n\n\u201cThis shareholder vote is a strong signal that you now have an absolutely well-informed body of shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judge in Delaware still could decide that this doesn\u2019t change a thing about her prior ruling and doesn\u2019t require her to make any different ruling going forward. But I think it definitely gives Tesla and Musk strong ammunition to try to get her to revisit this.\u201d\n\nIf the ruling stands, then Musk likely will appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, Lawrence said.\n\nMultiple institutional investors have come out against Musk\u2019s sizeable payout, some citing the company\u2019s recent struggles. But analysts said votes by individual shareholders likely put Musk\u2019s pay over the top.\n\nEarly Friday, Tesla disclosed that shareholders voted for Musk\u2019s pay package by 1,760,780,650 to 528,908,419, with about 77% of all votes in favor. The company\u2019s shares jumped 3% by the time the markets closed Thursday and were up 1.2% in premarket trading early Friday. \n\nAfter the votes were announced, Musk began telling shareholders about new developments in the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system. He has staked the company\u2019s future on development of autonomous vehicles, robots and artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d keeps improving with new versions, and its safety per mile is better than human drivers, Musk said. \n\n\u201cThis is actually going to work. This is going to happen. Mark my words, this is just a matter of time,\u201d he said. \n\nDespite its name, \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d can\u2019t drive itself, and the company says human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d hardware went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since as the company gathered data to teach its computers how to drive. \n\nIn 2019, Musk promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said in early 2022 that the cars would be autonomous that year. In April of last year, Musk said the system should be ready in 2023.\n\nSince 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d using volunteer owners. U.S. safety regulators last year made Tesla recall the software after finding that the system misbehaved around intersections and could violate traffic laws. \n\nMusk also said the company is making huge progress on its Optimus humanoid robot. Currently it has two working at its factory in Fremont, California, that take battery cells off a production line and put them in shipping containers, he said.\n\n"

In May, two big shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended voting against the package. \n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d Norges Bank Investment Management said in a statement on its website. \u201cWe will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics.\u201d\n\nTesla asked shareholders to restore Musk\u2019s pay package after it was rejected by a Delaware judge this year.\n\nThe fund, called the Government Pension Fund Global, which has a .98% stake in Tesla worth $7.72 billion, voted against the package initially in 2018.\n\nThe fund invests proceeds from the country\u2019s oil and gas industry to secure pensions for future generations in Norway. It is worth 17.80 trillion Norwegian Krone ($1.67 trillion). Because of its sheer size, the fund does not reinvest all its money in Norway, or it would overheat the economy. It invests in 72 countries worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Tesla is recalling more than 125,000 vehicles to fix a seat belt warning system that may increase the risk of an injury in a collision.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the recall includes certain 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles. \n\nThe seat belt warning system is supposed to provide audible and visual seat belt reminder signals to drivers to alert them that their seat belt isn\u2019t fastened. The NHTSA said that on certain vehicles, the audible and visual seat belt reminder signals were not going off at the time they were supposed to, which doesn\u2019t comply with federal safety requirements.\n\nThe NHTSA said that as of Tuesday, Tesla had identified 104 warranty claims that may be related to the condition. The company isn\u2019t aware of any collisions, fatalities or injuries that may be related to the condition.\n\nTesla, which is headed by billionaire Elon Musk, plans to start deploying an over-the-air software update to the affected vehicles free of charge in June. The software update will remove dependency on the driver seat occupancy switch from the software and only rely on driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate the seat belt reminder signals.\n\nLast month Tesla recalled 3,878 of its 2024 Cybertrucks after it discovered that the accelerator pedal can become stuck, potentially causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increase the risk of a crash.\n\n\n\n\n"

It was worth more early in the year, but Tesla\u2019s stock value has fallen about 25% since then.\n\nThe all-stock package, approved by the board and shareholders in 2018, rewards Musk for hitting milestones that include raising Tesla\u2019s market value, pretax income and revenue.\n\nIt had been tossed out by a Delaware judge in January who said the process for approving it was \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d The court ruled that Musk controlled the company\u2019s board, and shareholders weren\u2019t fully informed.\n\nBut the company said Musk deserves the pay because he turned Tesla into the top-selling electric vehicle maker in the world, increasing its market value by billions. \n\nEven with the reapproval vote, Musk won\u2019t get access to the stock options just yet. Tesla is expected to ask the judge to revisit her decision in light of the vote, and if she doesn\u2019t, the company probably will appeal the ruling to Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court. The whole process could take months.\n\nNo matter the outcome, Musk\u2019s package \u2014 the largest award to a CEO of a U.S. public company \u2014 is far above what\u2019s been granted to other chief executives. Here\u2019s how the package compares:\n\n\n\n\nThe median pay package for an S&P 500 U.S. CEO last year was $16.3 million, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. If you multiply that by 10 to get $163 million for a decade of work, Musk\u2019s earnings still would be 275 times greater.\n\nIn her January ruling that struck down the package, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick wrote that Musk\u2019s package, then worth about $56 billion, was 250 times larger than the median peer CEO\u2019s pay plan. \n\nThe top earner in the AP\u2019s survey was Hock Tan, CEO of artificial intelligence company Broadcom Inc. His package, mostly consisting of stock awards, was valued at about $162 million, when given to Tan at the start of fiscal 2023. Thanks to a surging stock price, Broadcom in March valued Tan\u2019s pay package, plus older options he hadn\u2019t yet cashed in, at $767.7 million. That\u2019s an amount easily eclipsed by Musk\u2019s potential haul of 304 million shares worth almost $45 billion. \n\nOther CEOs at the top of AP\u2019s survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million). \n\nTechnically, Musk got no compensation last year because he didn\u2019t get any stock options. But he stands to get even richer if his pay package goes through.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to calculate what Musk\u2019s annual pay would have been last year. The company says he got nothing. But if his compensation package makes it through the courts, his pay will be in the billions. According to the company\u2019s proxy filing this year, the median annual pay of a non-CEO Tesla employee last year was $45,811.\n\n"

One suggested U.S. companies slowed their hiring last month, falling well short of economists\u2019 forecasts for an acceleration. Another report, though, said fewer U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits  last week than expected. That\u2019s an indication layoffs remain low.\n\nA report released later in the morning offered more optimism, saying growth for businesses in the finance, health care and other services industries was stronger last month than economists expected.\n\n\u201cGenerally, business is good,\u201d one respondent said in the survey compiled by the Institute for Supply Management. \u201cHowever, there are concerns of slowing foot traffic at restaurants and other venues where our products are sold.\u201d \n\nStocks have struggled this week  after another dud of a report on U.S. manufacturing reignited worries about the slowing U.S. economy and how much it could hurt corporate profits. That has raised the stakes for a highly anticipated report scheduled for Friday. \n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s when the U.S. government will say how many jobs U.S. employers added last month, and economists are expecting an acceleration of hiring. The job market\u2019s performance could dictate how big of a cut to interest rates the Federal Reserve will deliver at its next meeting later this month.\n\nAfter keeping its main interest rate at a two-decade high to stifle inflation, the Federal Reserve has hinted it\u2019s about to begin cutting rates in order to protect the job market and keep the overall economy from sliding into a recession. The question on Wall Street is if that ends up being too little, too late.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 3.73% from 3.76% late Wednesday. It\u2019s down from 4.70% in April, which is a significant move for the bond market.\n\nPerhaps more importantly for investors, the 10-year yield is flirting with the end of a more than two-year stretch where it was lower than the two-year Treasury yield. That\u2019s an unusual occurrence called an \u201cinverted yield curve.\u201d Usually, longer-term yields are higher than shorter-term yields. \n\nMany investors see an inverted yield curve as a warning of a coming recession, and the inversion since the summer of 2022 has been a key talking point for market pessimists. Often, an inverted yield curve flips back to normal ahead of a recession as traders cement their expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. But the 2020 pandemic created a recession and resulting recovery that have often defied predictions and conventional wisdoms.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield was sitting at 3.74%, just above the 10-year yield. \n\nOn Wall Street, Old Dominion Freight Line fell to one of the sharpest losses in the S&P 500 after reporting discouraging revenue trends for August. It cited \u201csoftness in the domestic economy,\u201d along with lower fuel surcharge revenue for the weakness. The freight company\u2019s stock fell 4.9%. \n\nVerizon\u2019s stock slipped 0.4% after it announced it\u2019s  buying Frontier Communications in a $20 billion deal to strengthen its fiber network. Frontier Communications, which soared nearly 38% the day before, gave back 9.5%. \n\nOn the winning end of Wall Street was Tesla. It rose 4.9% after laying out a roadmap for upcoming artificial-intelligence developments, including the possibility of full self-driving  in Europe and China. \n\nJetBlue Airways flew 7.2% higher after raising its forecast for revenue in the summer. It said it\u2019s seeing better performance in the Latin America region particularly and that it picked up business when technology outages in July  forced rivals to cancel flights.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 dipped 16.66 points to 5,503.41. The Dow dropped 219.22 to 40,755.75, and the Nasdaq composite rose 43.36 to 17,127.66.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Asia and Europe.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1.1% after strong data on growth in wages there raised expectations for another hike to interest rates.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.\n\n"

    "text": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Three times in the past four months, William Stein, a technology analyst at Truist Securities, has taken Elon Musk up on his invitation to try the latest versions of Tesla\u2019s vaunted \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system.\n\nA Tesla equipped with the technology, the company says, can travel from point to point with little human intervention. Yet each time Stein drove one of the cars, he said, the vehicle made unsafe or illegal maneuvers. His most recent test-drive earlier this month, Stein said, left his 16-year-old son, who accompanied him, \u201cterrified.\u201d\n\nStein\u2019s experiences, along with a Seattle-area Tesla crash involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist in April, have drawn the attention of federal regulators. They have already been investigating Tesla\u2019s automated driving systems for more than two years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns.\n\nThe problems have led people who monitor autonomous vehicles to become more skeptical that Tesla\u2019s automated system will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. Stein says he doubts Tesla is even close to deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by next year as Musk has predicted it will. \n\nThe latest incidents come at a pivotal time for Tesla. Musk has told investors it\u2019s possible that Full Self-Driving will be able to operate more safely than human drivers by the end of this year, if not next year.\n\n\n\n\nAnd in less than two months, the company is scheduled to unveil a vehicle built expressly to be a robotaxi. For Tesla to put robotaxis on the road, Musk has said the company will show regulators that the system can drive more safely than humans. Under federal rules, the Teslas would have to meet national standards for vehicle safety.\n\nMusk has released data showing miles driven per crash, but only for Tesla\u2019s less-sophisticated Autopilot system. Safety experts say the data is invalid because it counts only serious crashes with air bag deployment and doesn\u2019t show how often human drivers had to take over to avoid a collision.\n\nFull Self-Driving is being used on public roads by roughly 500,000 Tesla owners \u2014 slightly more than one in five Teslas in use today. Most of them paid $8,000 or more for the optional system.\n\nThe company has cautioned that cars equipped with the system cannot actually drive themselves and that motorists must be ready at all times to intervene if necessary. Tesla also says it tracks each driver\u2019s behavior and will suspend their ability to use Full Self-Driving if they don\u2019t properly monitor the system. Recently, the company began calling the system \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d (Supervised).\n\nMusk, who has acknowledged that his past predictions for the use of autonomous driving proved too optimistic, in 2019 promised a fleet of autonomous vehicles by the end of 2020. Five years later, many who follow the technology say they doubt it can work across the U.S. as promised. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even close, and it\u2019s not going to be next year,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety.\n\nThe car that Stein drove was a Tesla Model 3, which he picked up at a Tesla showroom in Westchester County, north of New York City. The car, Tesla\u2019s lowest-price vehicle, was equipped with the latest Full Self-Driving software. Musk says the software now uses artificial intelligence to help control steering and pedals.\n\nDuring his ride, Stein said, the Tesla felt smooth and more human-like than past versions did. But in a trip of less than 10 miles, he said the car made a left turn from a through lane while running a red light.\n\n\u201cThat was stunning,\u201d Stein said.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t take control of the car because there was little traffic and, at the time, the maneuver didn\u2019t seem dangerous. Later, though, the car drove down the middle of a parkway, straddling two lanes that carry traffic in the same direction. This time, Stein said, he intervened.\n\nThe latest version of Full Self-Driving, Stein wrote to investors, does not \u201csolve autonomy\u201d as Musk has predicted. Nor does it \u201cappear to approach robotaxi capabilities.\u201d During two earlier test drives he took, in April and July, Stein said Tesla vehicles also surprised him with unsafe moves.\n\nTesla has not responded to messages seeking a comment.\n\nStein said that while he thinks Tesla will eventually make money off its driving technology, he doesn\u2019t foresee a robotaxi with no driver and a passenger in the back seat in the near future.

Most other autonomous robotaxi companies, such as Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and General Motors\u2019 Cruise, combine cameras with radar and laser sensors.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t see the world correctly, you can\u2019t plan and move and actuate to the world correctly,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a professor of engineering and computing at George Mason University. \u201cCars can\u2019t do it with vision only,\u201d she said.\n\nEven those with laser and radar, Cummings said, can\u2019t always drive reliably yet, raising safety questions about Waymo and Cruise. (Representatives for Waymo and Cruise declined to comment.)\n\nPhil Koopman, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety, said it will be many years before autonomous vehicles that operate solely on artificial intelligence will be able to handle all real-world situations.\n\n\u201cMachine learning has no common sense and learns narrowly from a huge number of examples,\u201d Koopman said. \u201cIf the computer driver gets into a situation it has not been taught about, it is prone to crashing.\u201d\n\nLast April in Snohomish County, Washington, near Seattle, a Tesla using Full Self-Driving hit and killed a motorcyclist, authorities said. The Tesla driver, who has not yet been charged, told authorities that he was using Full Self-Driving while looking at his phone when the car rear-ended the motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities reported.\n\nThe agency said it\u2019s evaluating information on the fatal crash from Tesla and law enforcement officials. It also says it\u2019s aware of Stein\u2019s experience with Full Self-Driving.\n\nNHTSA also noted that it\u2019s investigating whether a Tesla recall earlier this year, which was intended to bolster its automated vehicle driver monitoring system, actually succeeded. It also pushed Tesla to recall Full Self-Driving in 2023 because, in \u201ccertain rare circumstances,\u201d the agency said, it can disobey some traffic laws, raising the risk of a crash. (The agency declined to say if it has finished evaluating whether the recall accomplished its mission.)\n\nAs Tesla electric vehicle sales have faltered for the past several months despite price cuts, Musk has told investors that they should view the company more as a robotics and artificial intelligence business than a car company. Yet Tesla has been working on Full Self-Driving since at least 2015.\n\n\u201cI recommend anyone who doesn\u2019t believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock,\u201d he said during an earnings conference call last month. \n\nStein told investors, though, they should determine for themselves whether Full Self-Driving, Tesla\u2019s artificial intelligence project \u201cwith the most history, that\u2019s generating current revenue, and is being used in the real world already, actually works.\u201d\n\n"

But Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said some potentially concerning signals were also lying beneath the surface, including heightened uncertainty around November\u2019s elections. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.25% late Tuesday. \n\nThe problem for Wall Street is that even if more stocks were to rise, they\u2019ll need to do so by more than Big Tech stocks are falling because of the group\u2019s huge influence. \n\nNvidia, for example, fell 6.8%. That wasn\u2019t as steep as Tesla\u2019s drop, but it was still the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500 because its total market value tops Tesla\u2019s. A 1% move for Nvidia packs more punch on the index than a 1% move for any company other than Microsoft or Apple. \n\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude lost 57 cents to $77.02 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 57 cents to $80.25 a barrel. \n\n"

    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 A Delaware judge heard arguments Monday over a massive and unprecedented fee request by lawyers who successfully argued that a massive and unprecedented pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk was illegal and should be voided.\n\nAttorneys for a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package are asking Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick to award them legal fees in the form of stock in the electric vehicle company valued at more than $7 billion at current trading prices. The 2018 compensation package for Musk that was rescinded by the judge was potentially worth more than $55 billion. \n\nAfter a full day of expert-witness testimony and arguments by attorneys, McCormick gave no indication on when she would rule on the fee request.\n\nThe fee amount sought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys dwarfs the current record $688 million in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron.\n\nAttorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk.\n\nAttorney Greg Varallo told McCormick that he and his fellow plaintiff lawyers were simply asking for \u201ca slice of the value pie we created.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe did battle with the very best,\u201d Varallo added. \u201cLitigation against Tesla is never easy. There are companies who play by the rules every day, and then there are companies like Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff attorneys argue that their fee request is \u201cconservative\u201d under Delaware law. Instead of a typical 33% fee recovery, they note that they are seeking only 11% of the shares now available to Tesla as the result of Musk\u2019s options being rescinded by McCormick\u2019s ruling.  The judge agreed with the shareholder lawyers\u2019 argument that Musk engineered the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. \n\nFollowing the court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time. McCormick made clear, however, that the June vote would not be considered in determining the request for attorney fees. It instead will be the subject of a separate hearing in early August.\n\nMeanwhile, some opponents of the fee request argue that the plaintiff attorneys deserve no fee at all because they did not bestow any economic benefit on Tesla and instead may have even harmed the company. Opponents contend that the purported reversal of share dilution among Tesla stockholders is not a benefit to the Austin, Texas-based company itself and cannot be used to justify the fee request. They also note that the fee request fails to quantify or subtract potential negative consequences of the ruling, including the need to find a new way to compensate Musk for six years of non-salaried service to Tesla since 2018.\n\n\u201cThe market did not react like this rescission remedy bestowed any benefit,\u201d defense attorney John Reed told McCormick, noting that Tesla\u2019s market capitalization dropped by $15 billion after her ruling.\n\nSome critics argue that any fee award should be based only on the number of hours the plaintiff attorneys worked, and a reasonable hourly rate.

That approach could still result in a fee award of tens of millions of dollars. The current fee request equates to an hourly rate of about $288,000 for plaintiff attorneys and would result in an \u201cunwholesome windfall,\u201d according to opponents.\n\nAcknowledging the criticism that the fee request has received, plaintiff attorneys in a recent court filing proposed an alternative fee structure. Under that scenario, they would be willing to accept $1.44 billion in cash, equating to an hourly fee of about $74,000.\n\n"
